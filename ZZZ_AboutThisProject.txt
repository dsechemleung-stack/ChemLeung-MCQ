You are helping code a React + Vite web app called ChemLeung MCQ Platform. It’s a chemistry MCQ practice platform with multiple practice modes (Timed, Marathon, AI Daily Mission/SRS, Mistake Review, Custom, Millionaire game mode). The goal is to iterate quickly on UI/UX and features while keeping routing + translations consistent.

Tech stack
Frontend: React (functional components + hooks), Vite
Routing: React Router v6 (useNavigate, <Routes>, <Route>, <Navigate>)
Styling: Tailwind utility classes + custom CSS in src/index.css
Animation: Framer Motion (used heavily in the mode carousel)
Icons: lucide-react
Backend: Firebase (Firestore/Auth) — client-side integration in src/firebase/config.js and services
i18n: Custom language context with t() and tf() (translation + formatted translation) in src/contexts/LanguageContext.jsx
Core UX flows / routes (current convention)
Dashboard: /dashboard (default landing after login)
Practice mode selection (carousel): /practice
Standard quiz: /quiz
Millionaire mode: /millionaire
Auth: /login, /register
Key components & where logic lives
Mode carousel: src/components/FisheyeCarousel.jsx
Renders the practice mode “cards” (widgets) with special styling per mode.
Accepts an initialModeId prop to default the selected mode.
Practice selection page: src/pages/PracticeModeSelection.jsx
Hosts the carousel, handles selecting a mode and navigating into quizzes.
Main routing: src/App_Final.jsx
Defines /dashboard, /practice, /quiz, /millionaire, etc.
Root / redirects to /dashboard.
Header nav: src/components/Header.jsx
“Practice” must route to /practice and highlight on /practice and /quiz.
Millionaire game: src/pages/MillionaireQuiz.jsx
Handles the game UI, overlays/modals, lifelines, ladder, quit confirm overlay, etc.
Translations: src/contexts/LanguageContext.jsx
English + Chinese dictionaries including millionaire.* keys.
Styling conventions / sensitive areas
Layout consistency across mode cards is handled by a mix of:
Tailwind classes in components
Custom CSS classes in src/index.css (e.g. Millionaire card split layout, hex buttons, neon glow)
Avoid duplicating CSS blocks for the same class name (it caused overrides earlier, e.g. .pm-mill-title).
Millionaire mode has custom visuals:
Dark top / white bottom split
Hex-shaped “Start Session” button via clip-path
Neon/glow accents, icons positioned with absolute/flex combinations
How to safely make changes in this repo
Prefer small, targeted edits.
When changing routes:
Update all navigate('/') fallbacks to the new intended destinations (/dashboard or /practice).
When changing translations:
Add/edit keys in both EN + ZH sections in LanguageContext.jsx
Ensure UI uses t('...') instead of hardcoded strings.
Verify with:
npm run build (preferred quick correctness check)
