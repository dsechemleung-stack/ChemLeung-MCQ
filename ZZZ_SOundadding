Add classic Millionaire sound effect on each new question (play on question index change) with graceful fallback if asset missing/autoplay blocked

I can’t ship the official “classic Millionaire” audio clip for you (copyright), but I can wire the app so it automatically plays a sound on each new question as soon as you provide your own .mp3/.wav file. I’ll implement it with a graceful fallback (no file / autoplay blocked = no crash) and a “first user interaction unlock” so it works reliably in browsers.

MillionaireQuiz.jsx
+49
    play();
  }, [currentIndex, gameOver, savingReward, victoryOverlay]);
 
  useEffect(() => {
    try {

Question “classic Millionaire” sound on each new question
I can’t provide the official copyrighted Millionaire sound, but I did add support to play your own sound effect automatically whenever a new question appears.

What’s implemented
In src/pages/MillionaireQuiz.jsx:

The app creates an Audio instance for:
/millionaire-question.mp3
It “unlocks” audio on the first user interaction (browser autoplay rules).
It plays the sound on every new question (currentIndex change).
If the file is missing or playback is blocked, it fails silently (no crashes).
What you need to do
Add your sound file here:

/Users/Hugo/Desktop/chemleungmcq-platform-2/public/millionaire-question.mp3
Name must match exactly.

Status
Sound hook is wired up and ready; you only need to drop in the audio asset you’re allowed to use.
